## Developments

### Developers
PIQT is a free software project. The core developer team is same as [PIAX](http://piax.org/). The PIAX development team makes decisions related to the development of PIQT. Volunteers are welcome, but if you want to commit codes to the project, you need to join to the PIAX development team since the team needs to have copyrights to decide issuing PIAX binary code license.
