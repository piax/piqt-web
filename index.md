PIQT is a Java implementation of a peer-to-peer based distributed pub/sub broker.

* Connects applications via topic-base pub/sub (Conforms MQTT 3.1 standard).
* Distributed edge-broker model. Connects brokers via P2P and [STLA](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7417305).
* Embedded web-based easy configurations.
* Distributed access right managements.
* Free software (dual licensed under AGPLv3 and PIAX binary code license).

PIQT uses [PIAX](http://piax.org/en/) as an implementation of order-preserving structured overlay. PIQT also uses [Moquette](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.moquette) to conform MQTT 3.1 standard.
